Hi, this is my project I am currently making. 

My goal is to develop a model that can be used to detect fraud/money laundering in a blockchain system, as one of the main drawbacks of a public permissionless blockchain 
system is higher risk of fraudulent activity like money laundering or terrorism financing 

I try several different models. 

The first one I tried was a GNN. 

I have implemented a basic gnn on an arbitrary dataset, code is from geeks4geeks
